# Dereverb - Instructions
## First steps
At first clone the whole repository.

- **Dereverb - Project Presentation** is a presentation of the project. Please, refer to this for the **full bibliography**.
- **Audio source** are the audio used in our Colab. Do **not** rename them. 
- the branch **First-attempt**, contains various code and experiments. Refer to the **main** for the final updated work.

## Drive Folder
In order to exploit the full potential of our Colab, create a folder in your Drive where the files from **Audio source** are placed. That will also be the place where the final results will be saved.
